**json.compare** - A library, a set of methods allowing you to compare json documents. 
As result of actual comparison you get full difference report of.


Instead of writing loads of documentation we have decided to provide you with examples of snippets shown in example code. 

Each example code snippet is annotated with @Example annotation. 
(com.steammachine.common.definitions.annotations.Example). And therefore can be found in the rest of code. 

Please bear in mind that any parts of code (classes, methods, fields) are free to be modified or removed
unless annotated with @Api(State.MAINTAINED) or @Api(State.INCUBATING)

Take a look at the class 
'''
 com.steammachine.jsonchecker.examples.Examples 
'''
to start with.

At the moment the library has com.googlecode.json-simple:json-simple:1.1 dependency underneath. 
It will probably be gotten rid in future.

To build project use a command 
'''groovy
gradle clean build
'''
